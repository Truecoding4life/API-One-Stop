### Highlighted Features:

**RESTful API:** Utilizing Node.js and Express.js, the application provides both GET and POST routes to facilitate seamless interaction with the database.
```
router.get("/resource/:id", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    if (req.session.loggedIn) {
      const resourceData = await Resource.findByPk(req.params.id, {
        include: [{model: User,
          // include: [{model: Comment,}],
          },
        ],
      });
      if (resourceData) {
        const resource = resourceData.get({ plain: true });
        console.log(resource);
        res
          .status(200)
          .render("updateDelete", { resource: resource, loggedIn: req.session.loggedIn });
      } else {
        res.status(404).render("dashboard");
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});
```

**Database Integration:** MySQL is employed as the relational database, and Sequelize ORM streamlines data management, ensuring efficient and organized storage.

**Deployment on Heroku:** API Adventures is hosted on Heroku, ensuring accessibility and scalability. The deployment includes the necessary data, ensuring a fully functional application.

**Polished UI:** The user interface is thoughtfully designed, adhering to best practices in user experience. It ensures an intuitive and visually appealing interaction for users.

**Responsiveness:** The application is responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience.

**Interactivity:** API Adventures engages users by accepting and responding to their inputs. It fosters dynamic interactions to enhance user engagement.

**MVC Folder Structure:** Following the MVC paradigm, the project maintains a well-organized folder structure. Models, views, and controllers are distinct and logically organized, promoting code maintainability.

**Authentication with Express-Session and Cookies:** User authentication is a priority, implemented using Express-session and cookies. This ensures secure access to user-specific data and actions.

```
const sess = {
  secret: 'Super secret secret',
 
  cookie: {
   
    maxAge: 3600000, //1hr
  },
  resave: false,
 
  saveUninitialized: true,
 
  store: new SequelizeStore({
    db: sequelize,
  }),
}
  ```

**Environment Variable Security:** API keys and sensitive information are protected using environment variables, adding an extra layer of security to the application.
```
req.session.save(() => {
      req.session.loggedIn = true;
      req.session.user_id = dbUserData.id;
      console.log(
        'ðŸš€ ~ file: user-routes.js ~ line 57 ~ req.session.save ~ req.session.cookie',
        req.session.cookie
      );

      res
        .status(200)
        .json({ user: dbUserData, message: 'You are now logged in!' });
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    res.status(500).json(err);
  }
});
```

**Clean Repository:** The project repository adheres to quality coding standards. It demonstrates consistency in file structure, naming conventions, and follows best practices for class and ID naming, indentation, and includes high-quality comments for code documentation.

 **Random Photo Search Technology:** This application utilizes the Unsplash API to get a random photo and sets it as a Project or Resource category profile image.  The Unsplash API allows us to filter the searches and retrieve a random photo for the user and a search a topic related photo for the resource category.
 ```
    const url = `https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random?query=${category_id}&orientation=squarish&client_id=${api_Key}`;

    try {
    const unsplashResponse = await fetch(url);
    const unsplashData = await unsplashResponse.json();
    const image_url = unsplashData.urls.small;

    const response = await fetch(`/api/resource`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({image_url,}),
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      }
    })
   } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching photo from Unsplash:", error);
    alert("Failed to fetch photo from Unsplash");
   }
```
